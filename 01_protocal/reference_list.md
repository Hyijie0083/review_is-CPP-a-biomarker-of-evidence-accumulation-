    recommend 5: using data-driven correlation between EEG and modeling to define neural signature of EV. Then, they found some characters insteading of verifying it.
    - Use EEG and fMRI simutaniously
    - we regressed these EEG traces (for each participant individually) against the subject-specific average model-predicted EA response
    - We selected electrodes, which survived a one-sample two-sided t-test of the population of regression coefficients computed individually above, with a significance level of 0.05 (Bonferroni-corrected by the number of EEG electrodes).
